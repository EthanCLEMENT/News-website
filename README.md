# News-Website

I made this website as a side project in April 2022. The goal was to learn PHP and implement backend features to a scientific news website.

## Functionalities
A news website inspired from IEEE and MIT CSAIL's homepage. The website contains the following features :
-> An authentification system and the ability for a user to delete their account or change their password
-> The possibility for certain users to post articles, they can be edited, deleted etc
-> Any user can comment an article. The comments can be modified, deleted etc. Additionally, if a comment contains offensive words, it will automatically be deleted. 

## Run the website
The entire website was coded in HTML5, CSS, MySQL and PHP. In order to run it, you will need a local server environment such as MAMP that you can find here : 
```
https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/.
```
Once MAMP ( or any other local server ) is installed, you can copy paste the following URL :
```
http://localhost/Project%20IEEE/Homepage.php# 
```
which will redirect you on the website's homepage.
